# nlddoc

Turn a folder of markdown files into a searchable documentation website. No setup, no config files, just write.

## The Problem

You've got markdown files. Maybe a `README.md`, maybe a whole `docs/` folder. You want them to look nice and be easy to navigate. But setting up a documentation site means choosing a static site generator, writing config files, and dealing with build tools.

That's annoying when you just want to document something.

## The Solution

```bash
npx nlddoc serve .
```

That's it. Your documentation is now a website with navigation, search, and hot reload. Your folder structure becomes the menu. Your markdown stays markdown.

Want to deploy it? 

```bash
npx nlddoc build . ./website
```

Upload the `website` folder to any static hosting service. Done.

## Why This Exists

Documentation tools are powerful but overkill for most projects. You don't need a CMS. You don't need a build pipeline. You just need your markdown to be readable.

nlddoc wraps VitePress (which is excellent) and makes it instant. No `.vitepress` folder. No config unless you want one. Your docs folder stays clean.

Think of it like `python -m http.server` for documentation. Quick, simple, gets out of your way.

## What You Get

**Auto navigation** - Folders become sections, files become pages. If you can organize files, you can organize docs.

**Live preview** - Edit any file, see it update. Works exactly like you'd expect.

**Search** - Full-text search across everything. No indexing setup needed.

**Modern UI** - Responsive, clean, works on mobile. Dark mode included.

**Deploy anywhere** - Builds static HTML. Works on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or a web server from 2005.

**Actually fast** - VitePress is fast. This inherits that.

## When to Use It

Good for:
- Project documentation
- Team wikis
- Personal notes you want searchable
- API references
- Guides and tutorials
- Anything already in markdown

Not for:
- Blogs (use VitePress, Hugo, or Eleventy)
- Marketing sites (use a real framework)
- Heavy customization (use VitePress directly)

nlddoc is for documentation. It does that one thing well.

## Credits

Built on [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev). The heavy lifting is all them. This just removes the setup friction.
