# Getting Started

You don't need to know anything technical to use fastdocs. If you can edit text files, you can create beautiful documentation.

## What You Need

1. A folder with some `.md` files (markdown files)
2. That's literally it

## Step 1: View Your Files as a Website

### Mac/Linux Users

1. Open **Terminal**
2. Type `cd ` (with a space after cd)
3. Drag your docs folder into Terminal (this types the path for you)
4. Press Enter
5. Type: `npx fastdocs serve .`
6. Press Enter

A website opens showing your docs!

### Windows Users

1. Open your docs folder in File Explorer
2. Click in the address bar at the top
3. Type `cmd` and press Enter (opens command prompt)
4. Type: `npx fastdocs serve .`
5. Press Enter

A website opens showing your docs!

## Step 2: Make Changes

Keep that terminal window open and:

1. Open any `.md` file in your text editor
2. Make changes
3. Save the file
4. Look at your browser - it updates automatically!

## Step 3: Stop the Website

When you're done:

- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal window
- Close the terminal

That's it!
